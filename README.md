# OpenNMS Helm - PM/FM Console for Grafana [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/OpenNMS/opennms-helm.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/OpenNMS/opennms-helm)

Helm is a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) application that allows users to create flexible dashboards using both fault management (FM) and performance management (PM) data from [OpenNMS® Horizon™](https://www.opennms.org) and/or [OpenNMS® Meridian™](https://www.opennms.com/).

It is the successor to the original [OpenNMS Datasource for Grafana](https://github.com/OpenNMS/grafana-opennms-datasource).

## Getting Started

Consult the [Helm Documentation](http://docs.opennms.org/helm/branches/master/helm/latest/welcome/index.html) for help on installing, configuring and using the application.

## Issue Tracking

We use the Helm project in our [JIRA](https://issues.opennms.org/projects/HELM) instance to track bugs and enhancements related this to project.
