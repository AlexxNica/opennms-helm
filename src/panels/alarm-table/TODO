* Update the dashboard after an action that changes an alarm is performed (other panels may be affected too)
* Properly escape quotes in renderer.js
* Reduce the size of the actions dropdown - the row height diminishes significantly when these are toggled

Nice to haves:
* Drag and drop the column names for easy reordering
